## Why Cloud?

In today’s digital-first economy, the shift to cloud computing is no longer a trend—it’s a strategic imperative. Organizations across industries are embracing the cloud to unlock agility, scalability, and innovation at unprecedented levels. 

The cloud enables **on-demand scalability**, allowing businesses to expand or contract their infrastructure based on real-time needs. This flexibility reduces upfront investment and minimizes the risk of over-provisioning.

With cloud platforms, companies gain access to **global infrastructure**, meaning services can be deployed closer to users for better performance and compliance with regional regulations. This is especially critical for applications requiring **low latency** and **high availability**.

Cloud services also promote **rapid innovation**. Developers can experiment, deploy, and iterate faster using managed services, APIs, and automation tools. This accelerates time-to-market and fosters a culture of **continuous delivery**.

From a financial perspective, the cloud shifts IT spending from **capital expenditure (CapEx)** to **operational expenditure (OpEx)**, offering predictable costs and better alignment with business growth.

Security and compliance are no longer barriers—they’re enablers. Leading cloud providers offer **built-in security**, **identity management**, and **compliance certifications** that often exceed what smaller organizations can achieve on-premises.

Finally, cloud adoption supports **remote collaboration**, **data-driven decision-making**, and **resilience** in the face of disruption—whether it's a pandemic, cyberattack, or market shift.

In short, the cloud is not just a technology upgrade—it's a transformation of how businesses operate, innovate, and compete in the modern world.
## Cloud – What is it?
The term **cloud computing** refers to the **delivery of computing services** — such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—**over the internet** (“the cloud”). Instead of owning physical infrastructure, organizations can access resources on-demand from cloud providers.

At its core, the cloud is built on **virtualization**, which allows multiple systems to run on shared hardware. This enables **resource pooling**, **elastic scalability**, and **cost efficiency**. Users can scale up or down based on demand, paying only for what they use.

Cloud services are typically categorized into three models: **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**, **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**, and **Software as a Service (SaaS)**. Each model offers different levels of control, flexibility, and management responsibility.

The cloud also supports different deployment types: **public cloud**, **private cloud**, and **hybrid cloud**. These options allow organizations to balance **security**, **performance**, and **cost** based on their specific needs.

Cloud computing is defined by several **key characteristics:**
- **On-demand self-service**: Users can provision resources automatically without human intervention.
- **Broad network access**: Services are available over the network and accessible through standard devices.
- **Resource pooling**: Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model.
- **Rapid elasticity**: Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to meet demand.
- **Measured service**: Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, enabling transparent billing.

Beyond infrastructure, the cloud enables **global accessibility**, **collaboration**, and **automation**. It’s the foundation for modern technologies like **AI**, **IoT**, and **big data analytics**, making it a cornerstone of **digital transformation**.

In short, the cloud is not just a place—it’s a paradigm shift in how we **build**, **deliver**, and **consume** technology.

# Modern Cloud Computing
## History Lesson
The graph illustrates the steady rise in **global CPU workload** from 1995 to 2020, highlighting key shifts in computing paradigms that have driven this growth. Starting with **1st Generation Hosting** in 1995, the industry moved through phases like **Application Service Providing (ASP)**, **Grid Computing**, and **Virtualization**, each contributing to more efficient and scalable use of computing resources.

By 2015, the emergence of **Cloud Computing**—with services like **storage** and **SaaS**—marked a turning point, enabling organizations to offload infrastructure management and focus on innovation. The transition to **Open Cloud** by 2020, characterized by **hybrid models**, **APIs**, and **interoperability**, reflects a maturing ecosystem where flexibility and integration are paramount.

This progression underscores how technological evolution has led to increasingly **distributed**, **automated**, and **scalable** systems, pushing global CPU utilization to over **80%**. It’s a testament to how cloud-native architectures and service-driven models have become the backbone of modern digital infrastructure.

## The Organisational Dimension

The **organisational dimension** in cloud computing refers to the **degree of** **control**, **ownership**, and **integration** an organization maintains over its cloud infrastructure. This axis spans from **Private Cloud** at the bottom to **Public Cloud** at the top, with intermediate models like **Hybrid Cloud** and **Virtual Private Cloud** offering blended approaches.
- A **Private Cloud** is operated solely for one organization, offering maximum control, customization, and data sovereignty. It’s ideal for sectors with strict compliance requirements or sensitive workloads.
- A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** provides a logically isolated section within a public cloud, combining the scalability of public infrastructure with the isolation of private environments.
- A **Hybrid Cloud** integrates both private and public cloud resources, allowing organizations to optimize cost, performance, and security by distributing workloads across environments.
- A **Public Cloud** is owned and operated by third-party providers, offering high scalability and cost-efficiency. It’s best suited for general-purpose workloads, rapid deployment, and global reach.

Choosing the right position along the organisational dimension depends on factors like **data sensitivity**, **regulatory compliance**, **internal IT capabilities**, and **strategic goals**. As organizations evolve, they often shift between models, seeking the optimal balance between **control** and **agility**.

This dimension is crucial for aligning cloud strategy with business structure, governance, and long-term digital transformation objectives.
## Everything Can Have a Subscription

In the age of digital transformation, the way we consume technology has fundamentally changed. Instead of buying software or hardware outright, organizations now **subscribe to services** that deliver functionality, infrastructure, and platforms on demand. This shift is captured in the concept of **X as a Service (XaaS)**, where nearly every IT component can be delivered via the cloud.
