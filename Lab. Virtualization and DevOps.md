# Intro
Virtualization has revolutionized the way we think about computing resources. By creating virtual environments on physical hardware, we can efficiently allocate and manage resources, leading to improved scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. DevOps, on the other hand, is a cultural shift that emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to automate and streamline the software delivery process.

In this course, we will explore the fundamental concepts of virtualization, including hypervisors, virtual machines, and containers. By understanding these technologies and practices, you will be equipped to design, implement, and manage virtualized environments and streamline your software development and delivery pipelines. Â 

Throughout the course, we will use practical examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce our learning. You will have the opportunity to experiment with popular virtualization platforms, gaining valuable experience that will prepare you for real-world applications.

Until now, we've primarily focused on developing applications on our local machines. While this is essential for prototyping and testing, the ultimate goal is to deploy these applications to production environments where they can be accessed by users. In this course, we'll explore the techniques and best practices involved in bringing your applications from development to production.
