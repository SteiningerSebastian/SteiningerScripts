# Python
"In MicroPython, `print()` is a built-in function that allows you to display information on the console or serial monitor. It's a crucial tool for debugging and understanding the behavior of your code." (Murugesh, Vasudevan, &#38; Pulari, 2024, 1.2 What is Python? section)
## Print
In Python (MicroPython), `print()` is a built-in function that allows you to display information on the console or serial monitor. It's a crucial tool for debugging and understanding the behavior of your code.
## Variables
To create a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to it using the equal sign (`=`). The variable name goes on the left side of the equal sign, and the value goes on the right.
### Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

- **Numbers:**
    - `int`: Integers (e.g., 10, -5)
    - `float`: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, 2.5)
- **Strings:** Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'World')
- **Boolean:** True or False values
- **Lists:** Ordered collections of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
- **Tuples:** Immutable ordered collections of items (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
- **Dictionaries:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30})

You can convert values between different data types using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, etc.
## Lists
**Lists** are one of the most versatile data structures in Python. They are ordered collections of items, where each item can be of any data type. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after they are created.
### Creating Lists
To create a list, enclose a sequence of items within square brackets `[]`.
```
# Creating a list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Creating a list of mixed data types Â  1. codeverge.com codeverge.com
mixed_list = [10, "Hello", 3.14, True]
```
### Accessing List Elements
You can access individual elements of a list using their index, which starts from 0.
```
# Accessing the first element
first_number = numbers[0]  # Output: 1

# Accessing the last element
last_fruit = fruits[-1]  # Output: cherry
```
### Slicing Lists
You can extract a portion of a list using slicing.
```
# Extracting elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)
sublist = numbers[1:4]  # Output: [2, 3, 4]

# Extracting elements from the beginning to index 2 (exclusive)
first_two = numbers[:2]  # Output: [1, 2]

# Extracting elements from index 2 to the end
last_three = numbers[2:]  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```
### Modifying Lists
You can modify existing elements in a list or add new elements.
```
# Changing an element
numbers[2] = 100

# Adding an element to the end
fruits.append("orange")

# Inserting an element at a specific index
numbers.insert(1, 20)
```
### Removing Elements
You can remove elements from a list using various methods.
```
# Removing an element by its value
fruits.remove("banana")

# Removing an element by its index
del numbers[3]

# Removing all elements from the list
numbers.clear()
```
### List Operations
Lists support various operations, such as:
- **Concatenation:** Joining two lists using the `+` operator.
- **Repetition:** Repeating a list using the `*` operator.
- **Membership testing:** Checking if an element is in the list using the `in` keyword.
- **Length:** Finding the number of elements in a list using the `len()` function.
- **Sum**: Finding the sum of the elements in a list using the `sum()` function.
- **Max. Element**: Finding the greatest element in a list using the `max()` function.
- **Min. Element**: Finding the smallest element in a list using the `min()` function.
### Nested Lists
Lists can contain other lists, creating nested structures.
```
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```
## Loops
Loops are essential programming constructs that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Python provides two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.
### `for` Loops
`for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence of values, such as a list, tuple, or string.
```
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Iterating over a range of numbers
for i in range(5): Â  1. github.com github.com
    print(i)
```
The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers. You can specify the starting point, ending point (exclusive), and step size.
### `while` Loops
`while` loops execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
```
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
### `break` and `continue` Statements
- **`break`:** Exits the loop immediately, regardless of whether the condition is met.
- **`continue`:** Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.
```
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```
### Nested Loops
You can have loops within loops, known as nested loops.
```
for row in range(3):
    for col in range(3):
        print(row, col)
```

**Common Use Cases:**
- Iterating over lists, tuples, and strings.
- Performing repetitive tasks.
- Implementing algorithms like searching and sorting.
- Creating patterns and shapes.

**Best Practices:**
- Indent the code within the loop consistently.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Avoid infinite loops by ensuring the loop condition eventually becomes false.
- Consider using `break` and `continue` statements judiciously.

By understanding and effectively using loops, you can write more efficient and concise Python code.
## Functions
**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help you organize your code, make it more readable, and avoid code duplication.
### Defining Functions
To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. The code block that defines the function's behavior is indented.
```
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
### Parameters and Arguments
- **Parameters:** Variables defined within the parentheses of a function.
- **Arguments:** Values passed to a function when it's called.
```
def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result

sum = add(3, 5)  # Output: 8
```
### Return Values
Functions can return values using the `return` statement. If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it implicitly returns `None`.
```
def square(x):
    return x * x

result = square(4)  # Output: 16
```
### Default Arguments
You can provide default values for parameters. If an argument isn't provided when the function is called, the default value is used.
```
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

greet("Bob")  # Output: Hello, Bob!
greet("Charlie", "Hi")  # Output: Hi, Charlie!
```
### Keyword Arguments
You can pass arguments to a function using keyword arguments, where the argument names are specified explicitly.
```
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

greet(greeting="Hi", name="David")  # Output: Hi, David!
```
### Variable-Length Arguments
You can use `*args` to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function.
```
def add(*numbers):
    result = 0
    for num in numbers:
        result += num
    return result

sum = add(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Output: 10
```
### Docstrings
Docstrings are strings that describe the purpose, parameters, and return value of a function. They are enclosed in triple quotes.
```
def greet(name):
    """Greets a person by name.

    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet.
    """
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
**Key Points:**
- Functions promote code organization and reusability.
- Parameters and arguments allow you to pass data to functions.
- Return values enable functions to produce results.
- Default arguments and keyword arguments provide flexibility.
- Variable-length arguments handle an arbitrary number of arguments.
- Docstrings improve code readability and maintainability.

By effectively using functions, you can write more modular, efficient, and maintainable Python code.
## REPL: Read-Eval-Print Loop
A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive computing environment where you can enter expressions or statements, have them evaluated, and then see the results printed. It's a common tool for programming languages and is often used for testing code snippets, experimenting with language features, and debugging.

**How it works:**
1. **Read:** The REPL reads an input expression or statement from the user.
2. **Evaluate:** It evaluates the input, executing the code and calculating the result.
3. **Print:** The REPL prints the result of the evaluation to the console.
4. **Loop:** The process then repeats, allowing you to enter another expression or statement.

**Common uses of REPLs:**
- **Testing code snippets:** Quickly try out different code fragments and see the results.
- **Experimenting with language features:** Explore new language constructs or libraries.
- **Debugging:** Identify and fix errors in your code.
- **Interactive learning:** Learn a programming language or explore its capabilities.

**Examples of REPLs:**
- Python's interactive shell
- JavaScript's Node.js REPL
- Ruby's IRB (Interactive Ruby)
- Many other programming languages have their own REPLs.

REPLs are valuable tools for programmers of all levels, providing a convenient and interactive way to work with code.
## Time & Sleep
- **`time.time()`:** Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970).
- **`time.sleep(seconds)`:** Suspends the execution of the current thread for the specified number of seconds.
```
import time

# Get the current time
current_time = time.time()
print("Current time:", current_time)

# Pause execution for 5 seconds
time.sleep(5)

# Get the current time again
current_time_after_sleep = time.time()
print("Time after sleep:", current_time_after_sleep)
```
**Note:** The `time.sleep()` function can be used to create delays, implement timers, or control the pace of execution in your Python programs.

**Additional Considerations:**
- For more precise timekeeping, you might consider using the `datetime` module.
- If you need to schedule tasks at specific times, explore libraries like `schedule` or `APScheduler`.

By effectively using the `time` module, you can manipulate time and control the flow of your Python applications.
## MicroPython
**Python** and **MicroPython** are both programming languages, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
### Python
- **General-purpose language:** Designed for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and scientific computing.
- **Runs on various platforms:** Can be used on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems.
- **Extensive libraries and frameworks:** Offers a rich ecosystem of tools and modules for various tasks.

| Memory usage | Higher          | Lower                         |
#### Sleep
When working with microcontrollers, the `sleep` function is a crucial tool for managing power consumption, timing events, and controlling the overall behavior of your device. Different microcontroller platforms and operating systems may offer variations in the `sleep` function, but the core functionality remains similar.
##### Common Sleep Modes
Microcontrollers typically provide multiple sleep modes, each offering different levels of power savings and wake-up capabilities:
- **Idle Mode:** The processor is halted, but peripherals and clocks may continue to operate at a reduced frequency.
- **Power-Saving Mode:** The processor and some peripherals are powered down, while essential functions like interrupts and timers are maintained.
- **Deep Sleep Mode:** The microcontroller enters a low-power state, with only essential circuits powered. Wake-up typically requires an external interrupt or timer.
##### Factors to Consider
When choosing a sleep mode, consider the following factors:
- **Power Consumption:** The deeper the sleep mode, the lower the power consumption.
- **Wake-up Time:** The time it takes for the microcontroller to resume normal operation after waking up from sleep.
- **Interrupt Sensitivity:** Some sleep modes may have limitations on interrupt sensitivity or responsiveness.
- **Timer Functionality:** The availability of timers to wake the microcontroller from sleep.
- **Peripheral Support:** Whether peripherals can continue to operate in certain sleep modes.

Take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/powerctrl.html) if you want to learn more.

**In summary,** Python is a versatile language suitable for a variety of applications, while MicroPython is optimized for resource-constrained devices and provides a subset of Python's features. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of your project.
# Electronics
Electronics is the branch of science that deals with the flow of electric current and its application in various devices. It involves the study of components, circuits, and systems that use electricity to perform specific functions.
## Basic Electrical Quantities
- **Voltage (U):** The electrical potential difference between two points in a circuit, measured in volts (V).
- **Current (I):** The rate of flow of electric charge, measured in amperes (A).
- **Resistance (R):** The opposition to the flow of electric current, measured in ohms (Î©).
## Ohm's Law
Ohm's Law is a fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. It states:
**U = R * I**
where:
- U is the voltage
- R is the resistance
- I is the current
## Voltage Divider
A voltage divider is a simple circuit that divides a voltage into two or more smaller voltages. It consists of two or more resistors connected in series. The voltage at the junction of the resistors is proportional to the ratio of their resistances.
![VoltageDivider](./files/voltageDivider.drawio.svg)
## Potentiometer
A potentiometer is a variable resistor that can be used to adjust the voltage in a circuit. It consists of a resistive element with a sliding contact. By moving the contact, you can change the resistance between the contact and the ends of the element, thereby adjusting the voltage.

For example the ADC of the esp32 supports a range of 0.1V to 0.95V. This circuit uses a potentiometer to simulate different values. 
![Circuit Potentiometer high](./files/potentiometer_01V_095V.png)
![Circuit Potentiometer high](./files/potentiometer_01V_095V_low.png)
## Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)
LEDs are semiconductor devices that emit light when a current flows through them. They are widely used in various applications, such as displays, indicators, and lighting. LEDs have a specific polarity and require a forward voltage to emit light.

Dimming LEDs involves controlling the intensity of the light they emit. This can be achieved through two primary methods: Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) and voltage control.
### PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)
- **How it works:** PWM involves rapidly switching the LED on and off at a high frequency. The ratio of on time to off time determines the average brightness. A higher duty cycle (more on time) results in a brighter LED.
- **Advantages:** Highly efficient, precise control, and minimal power consumption.
- **Disadvantages:** May introduce noise or flicker in some applications.
### Voltage Control
- **How it works:** Directly varying the voltage supplied to the LED controls its brightness. Lower voltage results in lower brightness.
- **Advantages:** Simple implementation, no additional components required.
- **Disadvantages:** Less precise control, can be less efficient at lower voltages.

**Choosing the Right Method:**
- **Efficiency:** PWM is generally more efficient, especially at lower brightness levels.
- **Precision:** PWM offers more precise control over brightness.
- **Noise:** PWM may introduce noise, especially at lower frequencies.
- **Hardware:** The availability of PWM hardware on your microcontroller will influence your choice.

In many cases, PWM is the preferred method for dimming LEDs due to its efficiency and precision. However, voltage control can be a simpler option in some applications. Ultimately, the best method depends on your specific requirements and the capabilities of your hardware.
## Buttons
Buttons are simple mechanical switches that can be used to control the flow of current in a circuit. There are two main types of buttons:
- **Pull-up resistor:** A resistor is connected between the button and the power supply. When the button is not pressed, the input is high. When the button is pressed, the input goes low.
- **Pull-down resistor:** A resistor is connected between the button and ground. When the button is not pressed, the input is low. When the button is pressed, the input goes high.
## Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs)
ADCs convert analog signals (e.g., from sensors) into digital values. This allows microcontrollers and computers to process and analyze analog data. (12 bit, 0V - 1V)
## Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs)
DACs convert digital values into analog signals. This is useful for controlling analog devices, such as motors or speakers.
 
By understanding these fundamental concepts, you can build a strong foundation for your exploration of electronics and begin creating your own circuits and projects.
